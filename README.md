ember-leaflet-scaffold
======================

Basic 'app' integrating Ember and Leaflet, mainly as an example or a quick start repo.

This app uses Express to serve static files, and ready to deploy with some minor tweaks. 
On the client side, there is Ember and Leaflet, along with Bootstrap. I'm also using Gulp, for
the build system.


### Usage

```bash
npm install
gulp
npm start
```

### Todo

- As Component
- Browserify ember (currently it's concat)  
- Add sidebar  
- Wrap Leaflet events
